We'll illustrate this approach using the `ifcformant` tool found in the Berkeley Phonetics Machine. `ifcformant` represents the simple case in which a command line tool creates text output directly to a text file or STDOUT.\n",

Any notebook cell that begins with `%%bash` runs in a `bash` shell, and the commands that follow `%%bash` execute in the same way as they do at the command line. The `!` line magic is much the same but executes only a single line in a `bash` shell."
